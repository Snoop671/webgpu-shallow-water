# GPU Shallow Water Solver with WebGPU using Virtual Pipes Model

Welcome to the **webgpu-shallow-water** repository! This project focuses on implementing a GPU accelerated shallow water solver utilizing the virtual pipes model with WebGPU technology. By leveraging the power of GPUs and the capabilities of WebGPU, this solver aims to provide efficient and high-performance calculations for simulating shallow water phenomena.

## üåä About the Project
Shallow water equations are fundamental in simulating various fluid dynamics scenarios, such as ocean waves, river flow, and coastal interactions. The virtual pipes model is a concept that simplifies the simulation process by representing water flow as a series of interconnected pipes, making it easier to parallelize computations and optimize performance.
